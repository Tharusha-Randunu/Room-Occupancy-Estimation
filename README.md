# 🏠 Room Occupancy Estimation – Machine Learning Assignment  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **room occupancy** based on environmental sensor data using **machine learning** techniques. The dataset includes sensor readings such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and light intensity. The objective is to develop a classification model that determines whether a room is occupied or not.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding patterns in sensor data  
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features  
- 🏗 **Feature Engineering** – Selecting the most relevant variables for prediction  
- 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation** – Comparing multiple ML models  
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimizing models for improved accuracy  
- 📈 **Performance Metrics** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – Running the ML pipeline
